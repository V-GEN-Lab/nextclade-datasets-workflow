# ChikV Genotypes Dataset Workflow

This repository contains the source code and datasets used to implement the Chikungunya virus (ChikV) genotypes system in NextClade. The workflow is based on the organizational structure initially developed for the Measles, available [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/measles/tree/fe1d086f78711b2b9ea8d38bd4b45e1984a41760/nextclade_genome/defaults/genome_dataset).

## Overview

This repository contains the workflow for generating datasets from the representative trees produced in the ChikV Genotypes project. These datasets are designed for integration into the NextClade tool, facilitating the implementation and analysis of Chikungunya virus genotypes.

## Repository Contents

- **datasets/**: Contains the curated ChikV sequence datasets.
- **scripts/**: Includes the scripts used for data processing and analysis.
- **config/**: Maps various ChikV genotypes to the correct genomic annotation file.
- **resources/**: Files necessary for constructing and configuring the datasets.
